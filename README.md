# Googly

This is a clone of Google Search. I have developed it with ReactJS and implemented/styled every component in the app from scratch. I am using icons from `React-icons` and `React-router v6` for routing.

The app is hosted using Vercel. Visit the app [here](https://googly-lovat.vercel.app/)

This project follows the structure of my react-starter-kit which is documented at `./docs/README.md`

##### Features

- A mobile-first design approach and a fully responsive implementation. As shown in the photos below, the app at different screen size corresponds to Google's current implementation.
- For the backend, I am using an API scraper that retrieves Google search results in real time. Learn more in the  API Layer section.
