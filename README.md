<h1 align="center">Google ProSearchX</h1>

This is a fork of my Google search clone project ([Googly](https://github.com/mathewbushuru/googly)) but with additional features and enhancements to make Google Search more effective and powerful. 

It is designed for power users and professionals who require an easier and faster way to unlock Google's search capabilities. If you're like me and are tired of typing 'reddit' or 'stackoverflow' everytime on Google, then this would make a good replacement for your browser's homepage or new tab.

The React app is hosted using Vercel. Visit the app at [pro-search-x.vercel.app](https://pro-search-x.vercel.app/)

This project follows the structure of my react-starter-kit which is documented at `./docs/README.md`
